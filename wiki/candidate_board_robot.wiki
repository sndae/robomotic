Which linux board which should use for the main coordinator/robot?


= Suggestions =

This is a first list:
  * BeagleBoard: this one is been out for a while and looks pretty stable
  * Hawkboard: a new one but is cheaper and better suited for our purposes
  * Mini-ITX board: a bit exagerate for us
  * LinuxStamp
  * GumStix OveroFire: bluetooth and wifi chip already included!
