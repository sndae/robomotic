= Data labeling =
Every recording session should contain:

  # Type of recording
  # Type of task
  # Type of device used
  # Properties of the device used like number of channels, sensibility etc.
  # Timestamp and session duration
  # Access token
  # Link to related datasets
  # Privacy agreement  

= Details =
The data format for every channel follows:
{{{

int low alpha, 
int high alpha,
int low beta, 
int high beta,
