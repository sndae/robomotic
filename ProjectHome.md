# What is OSHA? #
OSHA is an open standard for home and industrial sensor networks.
The standard addresses the current lack of a uniform interface for accessing sensor networks deployed for home and industrial automation.
The standard includes:
  1. an abstract interface to transcode sensor data to OSHA data format
  1. a set of mathematical operations that can be performed over OSHA data
  1. a visual programming language based on drag'n drop functions for the generation of GUIs
  1. a standard architecture for the transmission of data over the internet

We are developing a proof of concept implementation that:
  1. acquire the data fro a mixed network sensor: XBee, Nordic, RF12B
  1. generate OSHA compliant data streams
  1. visualize it on the web
